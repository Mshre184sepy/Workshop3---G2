### Definition of Done (DoD)

The Definition of Done (DoD) outlines the criteria that must be met for any feature, task, or user story to be considered complete. These criteria ensure that the product maintains a high level of quality and consistency. A task is only considered "done" when it meets **all** of the following requirements:

#### 1. **Code Completion**
   - The code for the feature or task has been fully written and follows the agreed-upon coding standards.
   - All functions and logic are implemented according to the task's requirements.

#### 2. **Testing**
   - Automated tests (where applicable) have passed successfully.
   - The developer has manually tested the feature to ensure it works as expected.
   - Any bugs found during testing have been resolved.

#### 3. **Code Review**
   - The code has been reviewed and approved by at least one other team member (peer review).
   - Feedback from the review has been addressed before merging the code into the main branch.

#### 4. **Documentation**
   - The code is adequately documented with comments for complex functions or logic.
   - Any necessary API or feature documentation has been updated to reflect changes.
   - If applicable, README or user manuals have been updated to include new features.

#### 5. **Functionality**
   - The feature meets the functional requirements outlined in the user story or task description.
   - All acceptance criteria defined for the user story have been met.
   - Edge cases and error handling have been considered and implemented.

#### 6. **Integration**
   - The feature integrates properly with the existing codebase without causing any regression issues.
   - The feature works seamlessly with connected services (e.g., APIs, databases, third-party integrations).

#### 7. **User Interface (UI)**
   - The UI elements for the feature have been designed and implemented according to the design specifications.
   - The UI has been tested for responsiveness and usability on different devices (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).

#### 8. **Performance**
   - The feature performs efficiently without introducing significant delays or performance issues.
   - Any performance requirements or benchmarks have been met.

#### 9. **Security**
   - The feature has been reviewed for security vulnerabilities (e.g., proper data validation, and protection against injection attacks).
   - Sensitive data is handled securely (e.g., encryption, proper authentication/authorization checks).

#### 10. **Deployment**
   - The code is merged into the main branch without conflicts.
   - The feature is ready for deployment and does not introduce any breaking changes.
   - Any necessary environment configurations or migrations have been applied.

#### 11. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
   - If applicable, the feature has been tested and approved by stakeholders or the product owner during UAT.
   - Feedback from UAT has been addressed.

By meeting the above criteria, we ensure that every feature or task is fully completed and ready for release to users without any further modifications. This helps maintain the overall quality, reliability, and security of the product.
