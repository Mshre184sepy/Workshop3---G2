#### Group members: Shreya, Jui SachinKumar Parikh, Viet Pham, Razan Nayef, Melvin Ancheta

### 1. Describe the problem
1. Traveling can be an exciting experience, but the planning process can often feel overwhelming. Gathering information, booking accommodations, and organizing activities can be a disorganized and time-consuming task. Sharing itineraries with friends and family can also be unmanageable, leading to chaos and overlooked details.
   
2. 
### 2. Propose a solution
1. Our mobile app could make planning and organizing trips much easier. It would allow users to gather all the important details, like flight information, hotel bookings, and other activities, in one place. Users would be able to create day-by-day plans and add everything they need for their trip. The app would also connect to services like booking websites and maps, so users can find and book things without leaving the app.

   
### 3. List the technologies required by the solution
1. Mobile development framework (e.g., React Native, Flutter) to build the app's user interface and functionalities.
2. Mapping APIs (e.g., Google Maps) for trip visualization and navigation.
3. Cloud Storage: Services like AWS or Google Cloud to store and back up data.
